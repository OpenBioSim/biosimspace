Alchemical Transfer Method
==========================

In this tutorial, you will use BioSimSpace to set up and run a Relative Binding
Free Energy (RBFE) calculation using the `alchemical transfer method
<https://www.compmolbiophysbc.org/atom-openmm>`__ (ATM) on a pair of ligands bound to
`Tyrosine kinase 2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase_2>`__ (TYK2).

.. note ::
   ATM calculations are currently only available in OpenMM. As such, an environment
   containing OpenMM is required to run this tutorial.

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of the Alchemical
Transfer Method. If you are not, please see the `Gallichio lab website
<https://www.compmolbiophysbc.org/atom-openmm>`__ as well as the corresponding
publications for an in-depth explanation of the method, as well as the
intricacies involved in setting up an ATM calculation.

------------
System Setup
------------

Import :mod:`BioSimSpace` using:

>>> import BioSimSpace as BSS

Now load the set of example molecules from a URL, via
:func:`BioSimSpace.IO.readMolecules`:

>>> url = BSS.tutorialUrl()
>>> protein = BSS.IO.readMolecules([f"{url}/tyk2.prm7", f"{url}/tyk2.rst7"])[0]
>>> lig1 = BSS.IO.readMolecules([f"{url}/ejm_31.prm7", f"{url}/ejm_31.rst7"])[0]
>>> lig2 = BSS.IO.readMolecules([f"{url}/ejm_43.prm7", f"{url}/ejm_43.rst7"])[0]

In order to run an ATM calculation, a single system containing both ligands and
the protein in their correct positions is needed. This can be created using
functionality provided in :func:`BioSimSpace.FreeEnergy.ATMSetup`.

ATM calculations require that both ligands be present in the
system simultaneously, with one ligand bound to the receptor and the other free
in the solvent. As such, the first decision to be made when setting up an ATM
calculation is which ligand will be bound and which will be free. 

It is important to note that, while one ligand is chosen to be bound, `both`
ligands will bound to the receptor at some point during the calculation, the
choice made here simply defines the initial state of the system, and by
extension the `direction` of the calculation.

The first step in creating an ATM-compatible system in BioSimSpace is to create
an :class:`ATMSetup` object, which will be used to prepare the system:

>>> atm_setup = BSS.FreeEnergy.ATMSetup(receptor=protein, 
...     ligand_bound=lig1, 
...     ligand_free=lig2
... )

Before an ATM-ready system can be prepared there are decisions to be made
regarding the system setup, namely which atoms will be used to define the rigid
cores of the ligands, as well those that make up the centre of mass of each
molecule.

The choice of rigid core atoms is vital to the success of an ATM RBFE
calculation, and as such BioSimSpace provides a helper function to visualise the
choice made by the user.

>>> BSS.FreeEnergy.ATMSetup.viewRigidCores(
...     ligand_bound=lig1,
...     ligand_free=lig2,
...     ligand_bound_rigid_core=[14, 11, 15],
...     ligand_free_rigid_core=[14, 11, 15]
... )

.. image:: images/alignment_visualisation.png
   :alt: Visualisation of the rigid cores of the ligands.

.. note ::

    In this case the choice of rigid core atoms is the same for both ligands,
    but this is not always the case. The choice of these atoms should be made
    on a ligand to ligand basis.

    For help in choosing the correct atoms, see the `Gallichio lab tutorial
    <https://www.compmolbiophysbc.org/atom-openmm>`__.

Now that a sensible choice of rigid core atoms has been made, there are a few
more choices to be made before the system can be prepared. The most important of
these is the choice of displacement vector, which defines the direction and
distance at which the free ligand will be placed relative to the bound ligand.
It is generally recommended that this displacement be at least 3 layers of water
molecules (> 10 Å) thick. If no displacement is provided BioSimSpace will find a
best guess translation vector based on the relative positions of the protein and
bound ligands and translate the free ligand 20 Å along this vector.

This is also the point at which a custom set of atoms can be chosen to define the
centre of mass of both the ligands and the protein. In the majority of cases it
should not be necessary to change the default choice of atoms, but the option is
there if needed and can be set using the ``ligand_bound_com_atoms`` and
``ligand_free_com_atoms`` arguments.

Now that all the choices have been made, the system can be prepared:

>>> system, atm_data = atm_setup.prepare(
...     ligand_bound_rigid_core=[14, 11, 15],
...     ligand_free_rigid_core=[14, 11, 15]
... )

The ``prepare`` function returns a pair of objects, the first is the prepared
protein-ligand-ligand system, and the second is a dictionary containing the
choices made during the setup process. This ``atm_data`` object will be passed to
protocols for minimisation, equilibration and production in order to ensure that
options chosen during setup are properly carried through.

The prepared system can be visualised using BioSimSpace's built in visualisation
functionality:

>>> v = BSS.Notebook.View(system)
>>> v.system()

.. image:: images/tyk2_prepared.png
   :alt: Visualisation of the prepared system.

Now all that remains is to solvate the system.

>>> solvated = BSS.Solvent.tip3p(molecule=system, box=3 * [7 * BSS.Units.Length.nanometer])

------------------------------
Minimisation and Equilibration
------------------------------

Now that the system is fully prepared, the next step is to minimise and
equilibrate. The minimisation and equilibration of systems using alchemical
transfer is more complex than standard systems, and is a multi-stage process.

First, if positional restraints are needed, which is generally recommended for
ATM calculations, the decision of which atoms to restrain must be made. A
good choice for these atoms are the alpha carbons of the protein. These can be
found using BioSimSpace search syntax:

>>> ca = [atom.index() for atom in solvated.search("atomname CA")]

The system can now be minimised. Unlike standard minimisation, the minimisation
of an ATM system requires that several restraints be applied from the start.
These restraints are: **core alignment**, applied to atoms determined earlier, which
can be turned on or off by passing the ``core_alignment`` argument; **positional
restraints** applied to the alpha carbons listed above, set using the
``restraint`` argument; and a **centre of mass distance restraint**, which maintains
the distance between the centre of masses of the ligands, as well as the
distance between the centre of mass of the protein and ligands, set using the
``com_distance_restraint`` argument. The strength of these restraints is automatically
set to a set of default values that are generally suitable for most systems, but
can also be set manually by passing the relevant arguments to
:data:`BioSimSpace.Protocol.ATMMinimisation`:

>>> minimisation = BSS.Protocol.ATMMinimisation(
...     data=atm_data,
...     core_alignment=True,
...     restraint=ca,
...     com_distance_restraint=True
... )

This minimisation protocol can now be run as a standard BioSimSpace OpenMM
process:

>>> minimisation_process = BSS.Process.OpenMM(solvated, minimisation)
>>> minimisation_process.start()
>>> minimisation_process.wait()
>>> minimised = minimisation_process.getSystem(block=True)

Now the first stage of equilibration can be run. Similar to the minimisation,
this protocol has several restraints that are applied from the start:

>>> equilibration = BSS.Protocol.ATMEquilibration(
...    data=atm_data,
...    core_alignment=True,
...    restraint=ca,
...    com_distance_restraint=True,
...    runtime="100ps"
... )
>>> equilibrate_process = BSS.Process.OpenMM(minimised, equilibration, platform="CUDA")
>>> equilibrate_process.start()
>>> equilibrate_process.wait()
>>> equilibrated = equilibrate_process.getSystem(block=True)

.. note ::
   The equilibration protocol is set to run for 100ps. This is a relatively
   short time, and should be increased for production runs.

   Here the "CUDA" platform is explicitly set. It is highly recommended to use
   a GPU platform for equilibration and production runs, as the calculations are
   computationally expensive.

Now that the system has been minimised and equilibrated without the ATMForce
present, it needs to be added to the system. The first stage of this
introduction is annealing, which by default will gradually increase the value of
λ from 0 to 0.5 over a number of cycles:

>>> annealing = BSS.Protocol.ATMAnnealing(
...    data=atm_data,
...    core_alignment=True,
...    restraint=ca,
...    com_distance_restraint=True,
...    runtime="100ps",
...    anneal_numcycles=10
... )
>>> annealing_process = BSS.Process.OpenMM(equilibrated, annealing, platform="CUDA")
>>> annealing_process.start()
>>> annealing_process.wait()
>>> annealed = annealing_process.getSystem(block=True)

The annealing process is fully customisable, and any number of λ-specific values
can be annealed. See :data:`BioSimSpace.Protocol.ATMAnnealing` for full the
full list of annealing options.

The final stage of the ATM minimisation and equilibration protocol is a
post-annealing equilibration run, this time with the ATMForce present at λ=0.5:

>>> post_anneal_equilibration = BSS.Protocol.ATMEquilibration(
...    data=atm_data,
...    core_alignment=True,
...    restraint=ca,
...    com_distance_restraint=True,
...    use_atm_force=True,
...    lambda1 = 0.5,
...    lambda2 = 0.5,
...    runtime="100ps"
... )
>>> post_anneal_equilibration_process = BSS.Process.OpenMM(
...     annealed,
...     post_anneal_equilibration,
...     platform="CUDA"
... )
>>> post_anneal_equilibration_process.start()
>>> post_anneal_equilibration_process.wait()
>>> min_eq_final = post_anneal_equilibration_process.getSystem(block=True)

.. note ::
   A frequent source of instability in ATM production runs is an overlap between the
   bound ligand and the protein after a swap in direction. If this is encountered
   the first step taken should be to increase the runtime of the post-annealing equilibration.
   This gives the system time to adjust to the presence of the new ligand, without the
   reduced stability associated with a swap in direction.

-----------------------
Production and Analysis
-----------------------

The system is now ready for production. The key decision to be made before
beginning is the number of lambda windows, set using the ``num_lambda``
argument. If this value is not set, a default of 22 will be set by BioSimSpace.

.. note ::
   Keep in mind that, due to the nature of the alchemical transfer method, a single
   production run contains both the forward and reverse direction of both the free
   and bound legs, and therefore a larger than usual number of lambda windows is
   required for a well sampled result.

In addition to setting the number of lambdas, any or all of the λ-specific
values can be manually set, with the only condition being that the lists
provided are all of the same length, specifically they must have length equal to
``num_lambda``. See :data:`BioSimSpace.Protocol.ATMProduction` for a full list
of options.

In the case of this TYK2 perturbation, the default values for ``alpha`` and
``uh`` will need to be set manually, as the default values are not suitable.

>>> alpha = 22 * [0.1]
>>> uh = 22 * [110.0]
>>> output_directory = "tyk2_atm"
>>> production_atm = BSS.Protocol.ATMProduction(
...    data=atm_data,
...    core_alignment=True,
...    restraint=ca,
...    com_distance_restraint=True,
...    runtime = "1ns",
...    num_lambda=22,
...    alpha=alpha,
...    uh=uh,
... )
>>> production_process = BSS.FreeEnergy.ATM(
...    system=min_eq_final,
...    protocol=production_atm,
...    work_dir=output_directory,
...    platform="CUDA",
...    setup_only=True
... )

The ``setup_only`` flag is set to ``True`` here, this means that all input files
will be created, but nothing will be run. It is recommended to run production
protocols on HPC resources where multiple GPUs are available, as the calculations
can be very computationally expensive. 

Running the generated inputs is as simple as running the ``OpenMM.py`` script
contained in each of the labelled ``lambda`` folders of the output directory.

Once production is complete, the results can be analysed using the built-in
BioSimSpace UWHAM analysis tool.

>>> BSS.FreeEnergy.ATM.analyse(output_directory)

This will give the ΔΔG value for the perturbation, as well as the error (both in
kcal/mol).

That concludes the tutorial on setting up and running an ATM RBFE calculation!
