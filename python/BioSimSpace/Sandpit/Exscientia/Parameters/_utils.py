    Compute the formal charge on a molecule. This function requires that
    the molecule has explicit hydrogen atoms.

    Parameters
    ----------

    molecule : :class:`Molecule <BioSimSpace._SireWrappers.Molecule>`
        A molecule object.

    property_map : dict
        A dictionary that maps system "properties" to their user defined
        values. This allows the user to refer to properties with their
        own naming scheme, e.g. { "charge" : "my-charge" }

    Returns
    -------

    formal_charge : :class:`Charge <BioSimSpace.Types.Charge>`
        The total formal charge on the molecule.
